Compilation of report.c completed correctly. Warnings provided in 'compErr.log' for your information.
a: Is any IPC used for manage to compute communication? Yes
b: Is a shared memory segment being created after starting manage? Yes
c: Are processes monitoring signals (INTR, QUIT, HANGUP)? Yes
d: Report shows statistics properly for 3 computes
e: Is ‘report -k’ ending all processes and releasing the shared memory and message queue? Yes
f: Are computes starting properly, registering with manage when starting at 1 sec interval? Also, is manage handling more than 20 computes properly (denying registration)? Yes
(-3 Points) Partial g: Are computes ending their work well when interrupted by HUP, INT, QUIT? Partially: you should not execl(report -k) on every signal.
h: Can your computes work properly if they start at very apart N? (0 skips) Yes
i: Can your computes work properly if they start at very close N? (many skips) Yes
